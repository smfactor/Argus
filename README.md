A Kernel Phase Intreferometry (KPI) pipeline for use on diffraction limited imaging. Generates the aperture model, calculates kernel phases, and includes basic point source models for fitting single or binary sources. 

Basic code pipeline is here. Scripts to interact with it and tutorials are in progress.
